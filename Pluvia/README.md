Pluvia (Modified for use in RetroSn0w)
================

Important Notice
================

Development of Pluvia is now discontinued. Support for new iOS versions and devices will *not* be added in the feature. The only changes which *might* be made to Pluvia would be those necessary to make it function on newer macOS versions; such compatibility will not be added if it imposes a significant maintenance burden.

What is Pluvia? 
===============
Pluvia allows you to untethered downgrade your iPhone 4 without SHSH blobs! 

It uses the iOS 7.1.2 iBoot exploit "De Rebus Antiquis" by @xerub and @dora2-iOS.

Pluvia 1.6 Limitations
======================
* Only for Mac!
* Only supports iPhone3,1. 
  - Support for iPhone3,2 and 3,3 is not easily possible because the iBoot exploit utilized by Pluvia has not been ported to those devices, and there is almost no documentation of how to do so.
* Only supports iOS 5.1.1 (9B206), 6.x, and 7.x.
* Can only jailbreak iOS 5.1.1 and 6.1.3

**NOTE: 8GB iPhone 4's that shipped with iOS 6 can only run iOS 6 and newer, NOT iOS 4 or 5. This almost certainly can't be fixed.**

How to use Pluvia
=================
1) Creating the patched IPSW

Run ./make_ipsw.sh <Input_IPSW> jailbreak (if you want to jailbreak)

Or run ./make_ipsw.sh <Input_IPSW> (if you don't want to jailbreak)

2) Restoring the firmware

Connect your iPhone 4 and put it in DFU mode.

Run ./restore.sh <Patched_IPSW>

Wait for that to complete.

When your phone reboots the Apple logo should blink and then it will boot the older iOS!

Getting out of recovery mode after restoring to stock iOS
=========================================================
Run ./make_ipsw.sh <Any_Supported_Input_IPSW> reset

Connect your iPhone 4 and put it in DFU mode.

Run ./restore.sh <Reset_NVRAM_IPSW>
